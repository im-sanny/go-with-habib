### üñ•Ô∏è Computer Architecture (Basics)

- **Motherboard**: The main circuit board that connects and allows communication between all components (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, input/output devices).
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:

  - Often called the "brain" of the computer.
  - Performs calculations and logical operations using a limited set of instructions (+, ‚àí, √ó, √∑, AND, OR, NOT, etc.).
  - Two main parts:

    1. **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** ‚Üí does calculations & logical operations.
    2. **Registers & Control Unit** ‚Üí small, fast storage + instruction control/flow management.

- **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:

  - Primary memory, volatile (forgets everything when powered off).
  - Stores data and instructions temporarily for fast access by CPU.
  - Example: An 8-bit computer means each memory cell stores **8 bits** (1 byte).

- **Storage (HDD/SSD)**:

  - Permanent/non-volatile memory.
  - Retains data until manually deleted or rewritten.

- **Bus System**: Connects CPU, memory, and I/O devices (data bus, address bus, control bus).
- **Generations of Computers (based on technology):**

  1. **1st Generation (1940s‚Äì1950s)**: Vacuum tubes (ENIAC).
  2. **2nd Generation (1950s‚Äì1960s)**: Transistors.
  3. **3rd Generation (1960s‚Äì1970s)**: Integrated Circuits (ICs).
  4. **4th Generation (1970s‚ÄìPresent)**: Microprocessors.
  5. **5th Generation (Present & Future)**: AI, quantum computing, parallel processing.

### üìú History of Computing

- **Abacus** ‚Üí The earliest known calculating tool.
- **Binary Number System** ‚Üí Formalized by **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** in 1703, foundation of modern computers.
- **Charles Babbage (1830s)** ‚Üí Designed the **Analytical Engine**, the first concept of a programmable, general-purpose computer.
- **Ada Lovelace** ‚Üí First computer programmer; wrote algorithms for Babbage‚Äôs Analytical Engine.
- **Alan Turing** ‚Üí Father of theoretical computer science & artificial intelligence. Proposed the **Turing Machine** concept.
- **ENIAC (1945)** ‚Üí First general-purpose electronic computer, used vacuum tubes; could perform ~5,000 additions per second.
- **Transistors (1947, Bell Labs)** ‚Üí Smaller, faster, more reliable than vacuum tubes.
- **Integrated Circuits (1958)** ‚Üí Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce developed ICs, revolutionizing computer hardware.
- **Microprocessor (1971, Intel 4004)** ‚Üí World‚Äôs first commercial microprocessor (4-bit).
- **IBM PC (1981)** ‚Üí Popularized personal computing with a 16-bit Intel 8088 processor.
