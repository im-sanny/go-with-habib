**OS and Computer Architecture - Class 2: Operating Systems**

**Role of Operating System:**

- OS helps to run or execute programs in a system by managing hardware resources and providing an interface between hardware and software
- Program loads on RAM after turning on the system - RAM provides fast, temporary storage for active programs
- HDD/SSD only store data that we need for long time (permanent storage)
- CPU starts to work at the time we start or turn on our system and it keeps working until we turn the system off, executing instructions continuously
- OS helps to manage CPU scheduling, memory allocation, I/O operations, file systems, and provides security and user interface

**Early Computing - ENIAC Era:**

- **ENIAC** was starting era general purpose computer
- ENIAC used **punch cards** for:
  - **i. Input** (data and instruction)
  - **ii. Output** (result)
  - **iii. Storage** (storing temporary data - though it also used other storage methods like vacuum tubes and delay lines)
- ENIAC used to use **IBM's 80 column punch card** which used to have **12 rows**
- That time there wasn't any OS so everything had to be done manually
- Human operators physically configured the computer by setting switches and connecting cables for each program

**The Idea of Operating System:**

- The idea of operating system came from **operator** that used to operate ENIAC with punch card
- With time, to make the computer more efficient, they automated the work of operator with operating system
- **Operator** → **Operating** (automation of human tasks)
- **Automatic system** → **System**
- **Operator used to help running program in early days but manually**
- **OS also helps running program but automatically**

**First Operating Systems:**

- **1956 - GM-NAA I/O**: First operating system (General Motors - North American Aviation for IBM 704)
- First OS was **terminal based not GUI** (command-line interface, no Graphical User Interface)
- Early systems used batch processing - operators would load batches of programs to run sequentially

**Operating System Evolution:**

- **Unix** → **macOS** → **Linux** (influence and evolution path)
  - More accurately: Unix (1969-1970) influenced both BSD Unix (which led to macOS) and Linux (1991)
  - macOS has Unix foundations (based on BSD Unix)
  - Linux was inspired by Unix principles
- **1960** → **keyboard** (keyboards became standard input devices)
- **1970** → **mouse** (mouse was demonstrated in 1968, became popular in 1970s-1980s)

**Key Transition:**
From manual operation (human operators) → Automated operation (operating systems) to improve efficiency and reliability
