/*
Computer Architecture:

Motherboard → Connects CPU, RAM, storage, I/O.
CPU → Brain of computer.
 ALU = calculations + logic.
 CU & Registers = control + fast storage.
RAM → Volatile, temporary memory (8-bit = 1 byte per cell).
Storage (HDD/SSD) → Permanent, non-volatile.
Bus System → Data, Address, Control buses.
Generations of Computers:
 1.Vacuum tubes (1940s)
 2.Transistors (1950s)
 3.Integrated Circuits (1960s)
 4.Microprocessors (1970s–Now)
 5.AI / Quantum (Future).
if a computer is 8 bit then each cell of the RAM can keep 8 bit of data, so each cell can hold 0 to 256 in decimal number.


Computer History – Cheat Sheet

Abacus → First known tool.
1703 Leibniz → Binary system.

1830s Babbage → Analytical Engine (first concept of general-purpose computer).
Ada Lovelace → First programmer.
Alan Turing → Father of CS & AI, Turing Machine.
1945 ENIAC → First electronic computer, vacuum tubes.
1947 Transistor → Replaced vacuum tubes (Bell Labs).
1958 IC (Kilby, Noyce) → Multiple circuits on a chip.
1971 Intel 4004 → First microprocessor (4-bit).
1981 IBM PC → Popularized personal computing (16-bit).

OS and computer architecture class 2 -

os helps to run or execute program in a system

program loads on ram after turning on the system, hdd/sdd only store data that we need for long time.

cpu start to work on the time we start or turn on our system and it keeps working until we turn the system off,

os helps to

ENIAC was starting era general purpose computer that used to use punch card for:
	i. Input(data and instruction)
	ii. Output(result)
	iii. Storage(storing temporary data)
ENIAC used to use IBM's 80 column punch card which used to have 12 row.

that time there wasn't any os so everything has to do manually.

the idea of  operating system come from operator that use to operate eniac with punch card, with time to make the computer more efficient they automate the work of operator with operating system.
operator -> operating
automatic system -> system

operator used to help running program in early days but manually.
os also helps running program but automatically.

1956 - GM-NAA first operating system
first os was terminal based not gui
unix -> macos -> linux
1960 -> keyboard
1970 -> mouse
