/*
Computer Architecture:

Motherboard → Connects CPU, RAM, storage, I/O.
CPU → Brain of computer.
 ALU = calculations + logic.
 CU & Registers = control + fast storage.
RAM → Volatile, temporary memory (8-bit = 1 byte per cell).
Storage (HDD/SSD) → Permanent, non-volatile.
Bus System → Data, Address, Control buses.
Generations of Computers:
 1.Vacuum tubes (1940s)
 2.Transistors (1950s)
 3.Integrated Circuits (1960s)
 4.Microprocessors (1970s–Now)
 5.AI / Quantum (Future).
if a computer is 8 bit then each cell of the RAM can keep 8 bit of data, so each cell can hold 0 to 256 in decimal number.

Computer History:

Abacus → First known tool.
1703 Leibniz → Binary system.

1830s Babbage → Analytical Engine (first concept of general-purpose computer).
Ada Lovelace → First programmer.
Alan Turing → Father of CS & AI, Turing Machine.
1945 ENIAC → First electronic computer, vacuum tubes.
1947 Transistor → Replaced vacuum tubes (Bell Labs).
1958 IC (Kilby, Noyce) → Multiple circuits on a chip.
1971 Intel 4004 → First microprocessor (4-bit).
1981 IBM PC → Popularized personal computing (16-bit).

/*
OS and Computer Architecture:

1. OS (Operating System) → Bridge between hardware & software.
2. Main role → Runs programs, manages CPU, memory, files, and I/O.
3. When system starts →
	  i. BIOS/UEFI runs → loads OS from HDD/SSD to RAM.
	  ii. CPU executes OS + user programs.r7r[7]y'y
4. RAM → Temporary, fast, volatile memory.
5. HDD/SSD → Permanent storage.
6. CPU → Works continuously until system off.

Early Computing & ENIAC:

ENIAC (1945) → First general-purpose electronic computer.
Used punch cards for input, output, and storage.
IBM 80-column punch cards, 12 rows each.
No OS — everything done manually by operators.
OS idea came from automating operator’s manual work.

1956 ->	GM-NAA I/O – first OS (batch system)
1960s ->	Keyboard input, time-sharing OS
1970s ->	UNIX developed
1980s ->	macOS, MS-DOS (personal computers)
1990s ->	Linux (open-source UNIX-like)
2000s -> Now GUI-based OS (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)

Cpu and processing:
	cpu has 2 part in it:
	 i. Processing unit
	 ii. Register set

	 Processing unit has 2 part, one is Arithmetic logic unit another control unit.
	 Register set stores data and instruction temporarily and helps PU to complete task easily.

	 Register set has SP, BP, IR, PC and General purpose registers
	 SP -> Stack Pointer: points the top of the stack
	 BP -> Base Pointer: points the base of the stack
	 IR -> Instruction Register: keeps 
	 PC -> Program Counter
	 General purpose registers ->
