/*
Computer Architecture:

Motherboard → Connects CPU, RAM, storage, I/O.
CPU → Brain of computer.
 ALU = calculations + logic.
 CU & Registers = control + fast storage.
RAM → Volatile, temporary memory (8-bit = 1 byte per cell).
Storage (HDD/SSD) → Permanent, non-volatile.
Bus System → Data, Address, Control buses.
Generations of Computers:
 1.Vacuum tubes (1940s)
 2.Transistors (1950s)
 3.Integrated Circuits (1960s)
 4.Microprocessors (1970s–Now)
 5.AI / Quantum (Future).

Computer History – Cheat Sheet

Abacus → First known tool.
1703 Leibniz → Binary system.

1830s Babbage → Analytical Engine (first concept of general-purpose computer).
Ada Lovelace → First programmer.
Alan Turing → Father of CS & AI, Turing Machine.
1945 ENIAC → First electronic computer, vacuum tubes.
1947 Transistor → Replaced vacuum tubes (Bell Labs).
1958 IC (Kilby, Noyce) → Multiple circuits on a chip.
1971 Intel 4004 → First microprocessor (4-bit).
1981 IBM PC → Popularized personal computing (16-bit).
